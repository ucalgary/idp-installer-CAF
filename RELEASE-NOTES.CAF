			  Workaround:

			  	Post installation, replace sAMAccountName wherver it occurs in /opt/shibboleth-idp/conf/ with 'uid' to match your LDAP schema for both attribute-resolver.xml and login.xml

			Build is intended for CentOS6.5 and NOT CentOS7
				Workaround:
					Use the CentOS6.5 Minimal iso distribution for your OS.  This is the only platform CAF can support for the tool. 
					The tool MAY run on ubuntu but is NOT a supported installation environment CAF. This is to say that it may not behave as expected at this time & require hand edits around java support for installation.
			Installation completes, but may leave extra unwanted processes behind post install, prior to machine reboot
				Workaround:
					A reboot of the server to validate proper processes starting will eliminate the left over proceses.
